  <h5 style="text-align: center;" id="what-is-java">What is Java?</h5> 
  <p><strong>Java </strong>is a general-purpose modern programming language initially developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Sun Microsystems</a>, and currently owned by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" title="Link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Corporation">Oracle Corporation</a>. The key feature of the language is <strong>platform independence</strong>: it means that the same Java program can be run on multiple platforms without any changes! This principle is also known as <em>"write once, run anywhere"</em> (or <em>WORA</em>).</p> 
  <p>Java has been one of the most popular programming languages for many years. It has earned the top position in the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">TIOBE</a> index (a programming language popularity index). This language is used by a huge community of developers around the world! If you have a problem, you can always ask other developers or find a suitable answer online.</p> 
  <p>Java is used in our <strong>Android</strong> smartphones, the financial services industry, telecommunications, embedded systems, and in many other areas. Medical applications use it to store patient data, computer games, such as Minecraft, are created using Java; development tools like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse wouldn't exist without it.</p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;" id="a-short-history-of-java">A short history of Java</h5> 
  <p>The Java language project was initiated in 1991 by James Gosling and his colleagues. In the beginning, the language was called "Oak." Later the project was renamed "Java" as a reference to Java coffee. For this reason, the languageâ€™s logo is a cup of coffee.</p>

  <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>The logo of the Java language</strong></p> 
  <p style="text-align: left;">Sun Microsystems released Java 1.0 in 1996. After that, new versions were released every 1 to 3 years. Since Java 9, released in 2017, new versions have been released every 6 months. You can read more about its history and find the most recent version <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a>. Hyperskill currently supports Java versions up to Java 17.</p> 
  <h5 style="text-align: center;" id="some-important-features-of-java">Some important features of Java</h5> 
  <p>As we've mentioned before, the most important feature of Java is <strong>platform independence</strong>.</p> 
  <p>Another important feature is a <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>clear syntax</strong>. Many elements of the language are easy to read and are widely used in other programming languages such as C/C++, C#, JavaScript, and Go.</p> 
  <p>If you have ever written programs in C/C++, you know that manual memory cleaning can lead to bugs in the code. Fortunately, Java has a <strong>garbage collector</strong> that <strong>automatically cleans memory</strong> from unused objects during runtime.</p> 
  <p>It is also important to note that Java supports multiple programming paradigms; you will get to know more about them in future topics. Java is primarily an imperative language based on the object-oriented concept: almost every part of a program is an object. Therefore, a program itself can be considered as a set of interacting objects. Also, it partially supports modern programming paradigms such as <em>generic programming, concurrent programming, functional programming</em>, and some others.</p>

   If you are a beginner in programming, it may be difficult to comprehend all the features of Java right now. This is not a bad thing. Throughout this set of topics, you will learn about all of these concepts. Also, Java has comprehensive 
   <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">online documentation</a> that comprises guides, tutorials, specifications, API documentation, technical information, and more. We will refer you to it from time to time during your studies.

  <p></p> 
  <p>In conclusion, Java is a modern and popular programming language that can be successfully used in almost all domains.</p>
